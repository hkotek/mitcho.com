<p><strong>Note:</strong> I've been blogging off and on at mitcho.com since 2007. Entries ran the gamut, from bad jokes to reflections on travel, as well as my professional posts while an employee at Mozilla. In 2014, I took the opportunity to prune the archive. There wasn't much that I was actively embarrassed by, but the pruning was done to make the archive a bit more of a coherent history of my projects, and to make it a more inviting place for myself where I might write again.</p>

	<ul class="post-list">
	{% for post in site.posts %}
		<li>
			<span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

			<h2>
			<a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
			</h2>
		</li>
	{% endfor %}
	</ul>

	<p class="rss-subscribe">subscribe <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">via RSS</a></p>
