* **[turktools](http://turktools.net):** A set of free, open-source tools that aid in the construction of linguistic surveys for [Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk](http://mturk.com), developed with [Hadas Kotek](http://hkotek.com). The tools allow for the creation of a wide range of linguistic tasks, including linguistic grammaticality surveys, sentence completion tasks, and picture-matching tasks. Our tools further help streamline the design of such experiments and assist in the extraction and analysis of the resulting data.
* **[turkserver](http://turktools.net/use/server.html):** PHP scripts for hosting Amazon Mechanical Turk-style surveys on your own server
* **[lingconf.com](http://lingconf.com):** simple free WordPress hosting space for linguistics conferences
* **[LingBuzz RSS feed](https://github.com/mitcho/lingbuzzrss)** and **[twitter account](http://twitter.com/lingbuzz)**
* **[Better Linguist List RSS feeds](/blog/projects/better-linguist-list-rss-feeds/)**
* **[lingcrawl](https://github.com/mitcho/lingcrawl):** a tool for crawling and creating a local mirror of the LingBuzz archive
* **[colloq](https://github.com/mitcho/colloq):** software I maintained at MIT Linguistics for nominating and voting on colloquium speakers, now open-sourced
* **[The Antisymmetrizer](/blog/antisymmetrizer/):** an online tool which linearizes trees according to the Linear Correspondance Axiom (Kayne, 1994)

In a past life, I was a coder most active in the WordPress and Mozilla (Firefox) spaces. I have now essentially retired from professional coding to focus on my [academic work][1], but still maintain personal connections with these communities. From time to time I also consult and advise startups on language technology issues.

My most popular open-source project was the [Yet Another Related Posts Plugin][3] for WordPress and I also contributed for years to WordPress Core. I was also a core developer for the experimental natural language interface [Mozilla Ubiquity][5] (described in [this paper](https://mitcho.com/research/ubiquity.html)) and the [Tab Groups][6] feature in Firefox. Notable previous clients and employers include [Automattic][7], [Mozilla][8], [Gameloft][9], [MIT][10], [the University of Chicago][11], [Vlingo][12] (now part of Nuance), and [JDRF][13].
