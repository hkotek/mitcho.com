[Last week][1] I released [a proof-of-concept demo][2] of the [next generation Ubiquity parser design][3] and it was also the focus of discussion in [our weekly internationalization meeting][4].[^1] Christian Sonne even wrote a Danish plugin for it during the meeting—a testament to the pluggability and of the new parser design.

In addition, at [the Ubiquity weekly meeting][5], pushing this new parser into Ubiquity proper was identified as [a key goal of Ubiquity 0.2][6], making frequent iteration and debate over this parser essential.

To that end, I&#8217;ll highlight some of the changes made to the parser demo [codebase][7] in the past week: <!--more-->

*   [[left-branching]] support and a Japanese parser
*   basic French parser
*   a timer display
*   Danish parser by Christian Sonne
*   synonyms: as an example, you can now use &#8220;purchase&#8221; or &#8220;buy,&#8221; both of which point to the same verb.
*   verb name localizations: you no longer need to use the English verb names with different languages. (Currently only Japanese has any verb localizations.)
*   a number of optimizations and corrections

I encourage you to check out the demo again or [check out the source on BitBucket][7].

### [➔ Ubiquity Parser: The Next Generation demo][2]

I&#8217;d love to get comments, patches, or additional parsers! Thanks! ^^

    The weekly internationalization meeting, like all Ubiquity weekly meetings, are completely open to the public. We&#8217;d love to hear new voices contribute to the discussion! Take a look at [the schedule of upcoming meetings][8].
