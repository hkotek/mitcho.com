If you&#8217;ve ever subscribed to a new Ubiquity command before, you know the red screen of doom. Ubiquity currently takes users to this page every time they wish to subscribe to a new command. The current design is meant to encourage users to be aware of the possible security implications of enabling and executing a command, to avoid getting a [[trojan horse]].

The current screen, however, does not make subscribing to commands foolproof. I personally know I&#8217;ve subscribed to a number of commands without reading through the code, defeating the purpose of the anti-trojan horse display. Moreover, the page doesn&#8217;t give you any information on how you can use this new command. Especially given the inherent limited discoverability of a [natural language interface][1], taking a moment to help the user actually *learn* the command becomes key.

Today I did a quick mockup of what a friendlier command feed subscription page might look like. Take a look at this screenshot with some of the features marked:

<center>
  <a rel='lightbox[friendlierfeed]' href='/static/uploads/2009/02/new-subscription-page.png'><img src="/static/uploads/2009/02/new-subscription-page-small.png" alt="new-subscription-page-small.png" class='limages' /></a>
</center>

You can also check out [the page itself][2]. If you&#8217;d like to visualize it without the &#8220;trust&#8221; warning, you can also view [the trusted version][3].

This mockup here is but a first iteration. **What do you think about this subscription page? What is missing? What should be changed?**
