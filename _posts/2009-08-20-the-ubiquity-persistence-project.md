It&#8217;s often hard to remember Ubiquity&#8217;s presence and keystroke without a visual reminderâ€”even I often forget that I could use Ubiquity and end up going to a search engine or using the search bar for some quick lookup task. **What if the Ubiquity input were in the toolbar and always visible?** How would that affect people&#8217;s use of Ubiquity? And what could we make that look like and how would it behave? Today we&#8217;re kicking off the Ubiquity Persistence Project, a new Ubiquity initiative to explore what a persistent Ubiquity might look like in the Firefox toolbar.

In order to facilitate this discussion, we created the Persistence tool. With the Persistence tool you can quickly try out new design and interaction ideas, mocking things up with some simple [jQuery][1]-powered JavaScript and CSS and see your changes live. The Persistence tool is bundled with our [latest Ubiquity beta][2] (install link).

I just put together a screencast introducing the initiative, demoing the Persistence tool, as well as talking about this project&#8217;s relation to the ongoing work on [Taskfox][6]. We&#8217;ll look forward to your comments and designs! <img src="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />
