A couple weeks ago I gave a talk at the [Boston Javascript meetup][1] introducing Jetpack and filling people in in the latest developments in the project, including the [Reboot][1]. Between 20 to 30 people came to the talk which was at Microsoft Cambridge. Here are the slides from the talk:[^1]

[Extend the Browser with Jetpack][2]



<!--more-->I felt the audience was very engaged and we had almost a dozen questions in the question period and throughout. Most of the examples centered around the use of capabilities and the new security model. For example:

*   What level of granularity will the manifests have? Do you have to just say &#8220;I use xhr&#8221; or &#8220;I talk to twitter but not facebook&#8221;?
*   What will be the review process for capabilities?
*   What license will capabilities use?

Perhaps I simply did not present this material in the clearest manner (it didn&#8217;t help that I didn&#8217;t have any particular slides covering the [capability and manifest model][3]) but it also reflects the reality that these particulars of the manifests&#8217; security sections are still being fleshed out. I&#8217;m looking forward to [the next time I speak on Jetpack][4] when hopefully the discussion of the Reboot will be more concrete and I&#8217;ll be able to give a clearer overview and demo of these aspects of the Reboot.
