Now that \[[Republic of China presidential election, 2008|the Taiwanese presidential election]] is out of the way, the already pretty boring Taiwanese news has hit a new high in boringness, today asking if closer ties to the [[PRC]\] (with \[[Ma Ying-Jeou]]&#8217;s promise to open up the [[Three Links]\] (三通)) means we can have a panda now. No seriously. The people have been waiting.

This, together with [my currently daily train commutes][1], have led me to further explore the world of podcasts. I&#8217;m now a proud subscriber of &#8220;[The Bugle: the Audio Newspaper for a Visual World][2],&#8221; with [[John Oliver]] of [[Daily Show]] fame and [[Andy Zaltman]], distributed by [[The Times of London]]. Like a weekly audio Daily Show, except more British and thus more ridiculous. It&#8217;s fabulous fun, and perfect for those of us who hate reading.

Here&#8217;s a snippet from this past episode:

> USA and Britain are once again at the top!, of the western world&#8217;s teenage pregnancies – also called the two countries most committed to the [[war on terror]]. &#8230; What it also suggests is, as nations, we get overexcited in the prospect of an easy conquest without really thinking about the long term consequences.

So true.
