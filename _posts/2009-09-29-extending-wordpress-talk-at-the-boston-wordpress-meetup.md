Yesterday I [gave a talk][1] at the [Boston WordPress Meetup][2]. The Boston WordPress Meetup meets monthly at the Microsoft Cambridge Research Center which is a fantastic venue right on the Charles river. Last night we got to be up on the 10th floor which has a great view of Boston right over the river. There was pretty good turnout, with about thirty or fourty people there.

My talk was a general introduction to WordPress plugin development, beginning with the concepts of [actions][3] and [filters][4], and concluding with a description of [HookPress][5], my new plugin which enables [webhooks][6] in WordPress. Here are the slides:

The talk included some live coding which is always dangerous, but it all went off without a hitch.

[Kurt Eng][7] was kind enough to get video of the talk as well which hopefully we&#8217;ll get up on [wordpress.tv][8] in the near future. Bryan also sent me a link with some [photos on Flickr][9].

Thank you to all who attended[^1] and of course to Microsoft who provided the venue and food! The Boston WordPress Meetup is a great community and I hope to keep supporting it and its activities.
