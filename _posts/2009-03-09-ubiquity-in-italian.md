flod put up a nice blog post on [thinking about Ubiquity in Italian][1]. flod points out that what seems natural to him as a speaker is the use of the imperative form of the verbs, but that some verbs may not translate neatly, even following the [overlord verbs proposal][2]:

> For example, the verb “make” is quite difficult to translate (too generic): “to make” could be “fare”, but “fare grassetto” (”make bold”) doesn’t make any sense, people would use more specific verbs:  
>   
> *   make bold -> trasforma in grassetto (sounds like “change to bold”)
> *   make page editable -> rendi pagina modificabile

This is a great point. Although the overlord verbs may naturally map into many languages, it may not be perfect for some commands in some languages. **Where would English overlord verbs not translate well into your language?**

I suggest on flod&#8217;s blog that a &#8220;synonym&#8221; system could be implemented to map single verbs to specific overlord&#8217;ed functionality, but these would definitely have to be done on a language-specific basis, unfortunately adding a little work to the localization process.
