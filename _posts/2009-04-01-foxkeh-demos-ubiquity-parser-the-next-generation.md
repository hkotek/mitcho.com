I just made a screencast with [Foxkeh][1] to demo the [Ubiquity next generation parser demo][2] and to demonstrate how easy it is to add your own language. Foxkeh wants you to localize the parser into your language. How could you say no? ^^

  
[Foxkeh demos Ubiquity Parser: The Next Generation][3] from [mitcho][4] on [Vimeo][5].

There are some details which are not covered in this introductory video, such as how to deal with case marking languages or languages without spaces. Hopefully this&#8217;ll inspire some people to play with the demo, though. **I&#8217;d love to hear your comments! ^^**
