A few weeks ago I made some visual mockups of [how Ubiquity could look and act in Japanese][1]. Part of this proposal was what I called &#8220;particle identification&#8221;: that is, immediate in-line identification of delimiters of arguments, which can be overridden by the user:

The inspiration for this idea came from Aza&#8217;s blog post [&#8220;Solving the &#8216;it&#8217; problem&#8221;][2] which advocates for this type of quick feedback to the user in cases of ambiguity. Such a method would help both the user better understand what is being interpreted by the system, as well as offer an opportunity for the user to correct improper parses. I just tried mocking up such an input box using [jQuery][3].
