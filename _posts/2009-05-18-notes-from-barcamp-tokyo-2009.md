This past Saturday was [Tokyo BarCamp 2009][1] at [Sun&#8217;s Yoga offices][2]. I of course gave a presentation on Ubiquity and our recent [localization efforts][3], including [Parser 2][4]. As you can see, I signed up quickly:

Here are the slides I used in that session. There are two &#8220;demo&#8221; sections in the slides&#8230; the first was a simple demo of Ubiquity 0.1.x showing off the `translate`, `map`, and `edit-page` commands. The second demo was of [Ubiquity Parser 2][5] and showing off how little code it takes to [add your language to Ubiquity with Parser 2][6].

I also led a brief afternoon discussion on open ideas: the approach of working in the open, making the thought process and decisions public, not just the results. Here are the slides for that one:



My impetus for doing this discussion is probably clear to many—as I go back to [academia][7] this fall, I&#8217;ve been recently wondering about whether I could apply the open process used at Mozilla to my own academic work, blogging frequently about little thoughts and discoveries, even if they turn out to be wrong or dead-ends. For those who are interested, Brian Lockwood caught [some of my slides and the discussion on video][8].

I also found a great photo from the discussion—I&#8217;m right there on the left edge.

Sun&#8217;s facilities had a combination of different styles of rooms (lecture/presentation, this large seminar-style, a small-group one) which was very nice for different styles of sessions.

I really enjoyed meeting the Yokohama International School IT department folks who had an interesting presentation ([video][9]) on how they live stream their department meetings every week and try to be open and benefit from (and give back to) an ed-tech community larger than themselves. Other highlights for me included [[Mitch Altman]]&#8217;s session on [[hacker spaces]] and &#8220;hacking&#8221; of all varieties and sorts, Karamoon&#8217;s very knowledgeable longer session on security ([video][10]).

Finally it&#8217;s good to point out that my friend [Kim Ahlström][11] open-sourced his website [jisho.org][12]. You can now get that entire repository [on github][13]. He also demoed the Cereling library/wrapper for various parsers and morphological tools which [his company][14] will be open-sourcing in the future. Happy hacking!
