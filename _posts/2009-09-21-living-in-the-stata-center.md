We&#8217;re now three weeks into the semester at MIT where I just started a PhD program in [linguistics][1]. The Linguistics and Philosophy department is housed in The Ray and Maria [[Stata Center]], also known as building 32. It&#8217;s a [[Frank Gehry]] building and thus crazy looking.[^1]

<!--more--> We see photographers on the street from time to time taking pictures of the building. In fact, the first day I got to Boston this fall, I walked into my hotel room and there was a framed photo of Stata on the wall.

The department basically occupies the eighth and ninth floors of the [[Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr.|Dreyfoos]] tower side. There&#8217;s a nice common space with some red couches and a spiral staircase.

All of us first years share an office together on the ninth floor (32-D976). The room is elliptical, with our desks along the side with windows and the other &#8220;wall&#8221; being a series of wooden bookshelves. It&#8217;s great to share an office with the cohort, as we all take all the same classes the first year as well.

Here&#8217;s the room for &#8220;Meg Data&#8221; just across the hall from our office. I was really hoping it was a woman named &#8220;Meg Data&#8221;&#8230; marrying her would get me one step closer to becoming &#8220;Dr. Data.&#8221; Alas, &#8220;Meg Data&#8221; or &#8220;MEG Data&#8221; apparently is simply a label for some data store—possibly some servers. <img src="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />

The majority of the building is the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)][2] so there are posters up for fun-looking talks that I&#8217;m too busy for.

Here&#8217;s my desk (with [Foxkeh][3]!) and my new bike which I&#8217;ve been bringing up to the office. The final photo is a photo of me with an &#8220;I ♥ The Web&#8221; poster in commemoration of [OneWebDay][4].

We&#8217;ve been getting pretty busy with the readings and work for our classes, as well as occasionally hanging out. I hope to write some more posts both linguistic and non-linguistic in the coming days on life at MIT.

    It also apparently has some structural problems; most notably [leaks][5].
