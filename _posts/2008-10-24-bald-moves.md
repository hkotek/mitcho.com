On September 19th, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson made a speech regarding the \[[Troubled Assets Relief Program]\] (TARP) to allay the fears of investors:

> I am convinced that this **bald approach** will cost American families far less than the alternativeâ€”a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets unable to fund economic expansion.



Unfortunately, the key phrase in this passage was widely mistranscribed in the media as a &#8220;bold approach.&#8221; But now that more details of the new Troubled Asset Relief Program have being released, Secretary Paulson&#8217;s true intentions are clear.

Will this new program stem the global credit crisis? Maybe. But at least we can all agree&#8230; it&#8217;s a bald move.
