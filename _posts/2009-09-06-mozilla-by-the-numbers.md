About six months ago [I started working][1] for Mozilla Labs full-time, focusing on [Ubiquity][2], the multilingual natural language interface for the browser. This week marked my last week on contract as I go back to [grad school][3] next week. While the work will go on and I hope to continue to stay involved as time allows, here&#8217;s a quick bird&#8217;s eye view of my activities in my Mozilla tenure:
