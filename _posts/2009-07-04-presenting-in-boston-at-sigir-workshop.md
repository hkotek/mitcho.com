I have been accepted to present a short paper entitled &#8220;Ubiquity: Designing a Multilingual Natural Language Interface&#8221; at the ACM [SIGIR][1] Workshop on [Information Access in a Multilingual World][2] in Boston on July 23rd. I&#8217;ll probably be there in Boston a few days before or after as well in order to find an apartment for the fall. If anyone is in Boston at that time and would like to meet up, or if you&#8217;re near Cambridge and looking for an apartment-mate, please let me know. <img src="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

If you would like to see a preprint of the paper, please contact me at `x@x.com` where `x=mitcho`.
