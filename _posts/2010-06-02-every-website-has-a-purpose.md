Every website has a purpose. Maybe you want people to buy a product, donate to your cause, download your app, or subscribe to your mailing list. How can you confidently modify your site to make it more effective with respect to this goal?

**A/B testing** is a process by which multiple variants of a website are presented to different users randomly and statistical tools are used to see whether any variant is more *effective*, according to an overall goal metric such as conversions or revenue.

While various A/B testing products—many free—exist, none are made from the ground up to work within the WordPress ecosystem. I believe a solution made particularly for WordPress could make A/B testing so much easier and more straightforward, and that such a solution could be greatly beneficial to the platform as a whole.

I&#8217;m happy to announce my new project, code-named **ShrimpTest**,[^1] which is directly aimed at filling this void. I&#8217;ll be working on this project this summer together with the fantastic folks at [Automattic][1].

The best way to keep up with development is on the project&#8217;s development blog, [the ShrimpTest P2][2]. Most updates will most likely be much shorter than this initial post. <img src="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> You can get less frequent, milestone-like updates by [following ShrimpTest on twitter][3]. Development will be [open][4] so feel free to check it out (haha) and submit patches as well. As I go along, I&#8217;ll also look forward to your feedback.

    Five dollars to the first person to correctly guess why I&#8217;m calling it ShrimpTest.
