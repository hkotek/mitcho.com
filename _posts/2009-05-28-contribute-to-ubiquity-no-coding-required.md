[Jono][1]&#8217;s recently been thinking about how to get users involved with aside from programming, and he decided to put the textual content of Ubiquity&#8217;s builtin commands and the new interactive tutorial on the wiki for all to edit.

*   [Command documentation wiki][2]
*   [Interactive tutorial wiki][3]

Changes made to these wiki pages will be tracked and edits will be moved back into the Ubiquity codebase as early as 0.1.9.

Combined with the [imminent internationalization of Ubiquity commands][4], allowing contributors to localize commands without digging into the JavaScript code, there will soon be lots of different ways for to get involved with the further development of Ubiquity!
