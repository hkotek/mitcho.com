In my recent [quest for podcasts][1], I just today discovered [[Jerrold Sadock|Jerry Sadock&#8217;s]] [Automodular Grammar lectures on iTunes U][2], brought to you by the University of Arizona. This is essentially the first few lectures from his Automodular course I took my last year in college, which was one of my favorite and most thought-provoking and challenging (&#8220;thought-challenging&#8221;?) courses while at [Chicago][3]. While I still feel that having visuals (slides, or his handsome face, above), you can download his talks and handouts separately from their website, linked here:

1.  Automodular Grammar 1. Jerry Sadock, University of Chicago, January 18, 2008. [Lecture (mp3)][4], [handout (PDF)][5]
2.  Automodular Grammar 2. Jerry Sadock, University of Chicago, January 25, 2008. [Lecture (mp3)][6], [handout (PDF)][7]
3.  Automodular Grammar 3: The Passive. Jerry Sadock, University of Chicago, February 1, 2008. [Lecture (mp3)][8], [handout (PDF)][9]
