I&#8217;m flying over the pacific ocean right now but a little bit of language caught my eye. Here&#8217;s a picture of the menu for this flight, in three languages: English, Japanese, Chinese.

<img src="/static/uploads/2009/03/menu1.jpg" alt="menu.jpg" border="0" width="650" height="459" />

What caught my eye is the line &#8220;served with ご一緒に 配,&#8221; meant to be read as part of &#8220;Beef in BBQ sauce&#8230; **served with** Pepsi&#8230;&#8221;. The Chinese 配 (*pèi*) is fine here, meaning &#8220;with,&#8221; but the Japanese &#8220;ご一緒に&#8221; (*goissho-ni*) seemed awkward to me.

The issue is that this adverbial meaning &#8220;together&#8221; normally comes *after* the &#8220;what it&#8217;s with&#8221; in an order like (1) (glossed in (2)):

<pre lang='Japanese' line='1'>A B-と       ご一緒に
A B-and/with together</pre>

In other words, where English and Chinese both would say &#8220;A with B&#8221;, it is most natural in Japanese to say the equivalent of &#8220;A B with (together)&#8221;.[^1] This is the reason why it seems unnatural to have anything between the &#8220;Beef in BBQ sauce&#8230;&#8221; line and &#8220;Pepsi&#8230;&#8221; line.

Looking at the rest of the menu, it&#8217;s clear that this isn&#8217;t a case where a native speaker wasn&#8217;t involved with the writing of the menu—the rest of the Japanese is perfect. *The Japanese modifier was inserted there just for the sake of parallel design, to the detriment of the text&#8217;s naturalness.* **When have you seen design conflict with the structure of your language?**

[^1]:    
    This can be generalized to a certain extent by noting that English and Chinese are both \[[head-initial]\] (aka &#8220;right branching&#8221;) languages, while Japanese is strongly \[[head-final]\] (aka &#8220;left branching&#8221;).
