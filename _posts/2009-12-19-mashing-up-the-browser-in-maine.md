Last week I was invited to give a talk at the [TechMaine annual conference][1] in Portland, Maine.

Being a longer time slot than I previously have used to talk about Ubiquity, I decided to dedicate a good portion of the talk to [Jetpack][2]. Being outside of Mozilla for the past few months, this gave me an opportunity to get reacquainted with the Jetpack APIs. I myself was impressed by how easy it was to develop a quick Jetpack. I ended up preparing two to live-code during the talk: one called [Helvetica][3] which, with one click, replaces all fonts on the current page with Helvetica; and [You Are Here][4] which uses an open API from [IPinfoDB][5] to display the physical location of the domain you are currently visiting in the status bar. Both are now on the [Jetpack Gallery][6].

Unfortunately there was a bit of a snowstorm leading up to the event, but there was still a nice turnout and I got to meet some fantastic people there. Ken Shoemake of [[slerp]] and [[quaternion]] fame came up to me after my talk and said &#8220;the Ubiquity parser reminded me of the dancing bear&#8230; it&#8217;s less surprising that it works well as that it works at all.&#8221; <img src="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> I also enjoyed the other great presentations in the technology track, covering the [virtues of REST][7] and basic iPhone development.
