Earlier today [I blogged on three different strategies][1] languages use to mark the roles of different arguments: word order, marking on the arguments, and marking on the verbs.

I gathered some data from the fantastic [World Atlas of Language Structures][2] to put together a survey of many of the languages on the Internet. For each of the languages, I got the canonical word order and whether the language marks the role of its argument on the verb and/or the arguments themselves.

As you can see, there are a number of data points that are still missing. **Please contribute information on the languages you speak!** You can [edit the spreadsheet on Google Docs][3]. Thanks!
