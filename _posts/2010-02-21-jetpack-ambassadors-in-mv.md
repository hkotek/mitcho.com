A couple weeks ago I went out to Mozilla HQ in Mountain View for a Jetpack Ambassador meetup. [Jetpack][1] is a project at [Mozilla labs][2] intended to make writing Firefox add-ons easier, and shares some ancestry with the Ubiquity project dear to my heart. The [Jetpack Ambassadors][3] are a team of Mozilla community members who will be involved with Jetpack marketing, evangelizing Jetpack and writing about our own experiences working with the exciting new Jetpack architecture.

We spent a good chunk of time with a team from [Invisible Elephant][4] who came in to give us some training on making technical presentations, and then dug into the code on Day 2. It was great to have the geniuses at Mozilla Labs like Atul and Myk show us the latest Jetpack code as well as get the latest project direction from Daniel, Aza, and Nick, from which we could see the amount of careful consideration and effort that&#8217;s gone into [the Jetpack reboot][5].

The best part of the whole experience, though, has to be the fellowship with the other Jetpack Ambassadors. The Ambassadors came from all over the world, encompassing Europe, Asia, S. America, and of course N. America. Each are involved with some really exciting projects and have each made a name for themselves in their respective communities. I&#8217;ve put together [a twitter list][6] of all the Jetpack Ambassadors and the core team members and invite you to follow them.

We also had the greatest number of [Ubiquity][7] core developers to have ever been in the same place at the same time, which of course had to be documented. <img src="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

I had a fantastic time in MV and it was a shame I could only be there for such a short time. I feel honored to be a part of this group and am looking forward to speaking on Jetpack soon [at an event near you][9]!
