> I have found that when you finally come down to the day <del datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">the scene is going to be shot</del> <ins datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">of the elicitation</ins> and you arrive on the location with the <del datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">actors</del> <ins datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">speakers</ins>, having had the experience of already seeing some <del datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">scenes shot</del> <ins datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">data</ins>, somehow itâ€™s always different. You find out that you have not really explored the <del datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">scene</del> <ins datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">language</ins> to its fullest extent. You may have been thinking about it incorrectly, or you may simply not have discovered one of the variations which now in context with everything else that you have <del datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">shot</del> <ins datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">elicited</ins> is simply better than anything you had previously thought of. The reality of the final moment, <del datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">just before shooting</del>, is so powerful that all previous analysis must yield before the impressions you receive under these circumstances, and unless you use this feedback to your positive advantage, unless you adjust to it, adapt to it and accept the sometimes terrifying weaknesses it can expose, you can never realize the most out of your <del datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">film</del> <ins datetime="2013-07-30T02:45:45+00:00">fieldwork</ins>.
