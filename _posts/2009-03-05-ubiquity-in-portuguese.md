Felipe, a Ubiquity user, put together a wonderful look at [what Ubiquity might look like in Portuguese][1]. He has some great points here particularly regarding the &#8220;map&#8221; verb used in English—Felipe points out that Portuguese does not have a very common &#8220;map&#8221; verb and that it would be much more common to use enter `me dê` (literally *me give*) to use a verb to *request* a map. This is a great example of how Jono&#8217;s [overlord verbs proposal][2] may be an important aspect of our i18n efforts. The post is also timely as we&#8217;ve recently been discussing in our [regular meetings][3] (open to all!) that Portuguese may/could be the focus of our next parser construction efforts.

**What would the challenges be for Ubiquity in your language?** We&#8217;d love to see an increasing number of blog posts on this topic in different languages. Thanks Felipe! ^^
