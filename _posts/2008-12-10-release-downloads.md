This is what the latest release (2.1.6) of my [Yet Another Related Posts Plugin][1] looked like under [Mint][2], using my WordPress plugin downloads pepper, which in turn gets its data from [wordpress.org][3]:

It&#8217;s always interesting to see these release spikes in download traffic. Note that this release was on the Wednesday but that was during the day, so Wednesday&#8217;s traffic is still higher than the normal ~300/day level, while the big peak (by day) is on Thursday. Too bad wordpress.org doesn&#8217;t give me hourly stats, though I guess that would be a little ridiculous.

YARPP is just about at that 35k download mark. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next release. ^^
