This past weekend I gave a couple talks at the inaugural [WordCamp Boston][1]. [WordCamps][2] are local, community-organized events for [WordPress][3] users and enthusiasts. We had about 400 people at the Microsoft Cambridge campus.

(I invite you to also check out more photos below as well as my [full WordCamp gallery][4].)

My first talk was &#8220;Getting Into The Loop,&#8221; which gives a quick taste of [The Loop][5] which is a central programming construct in every WordPress application. ([SlideShare][6], [SpeakerRate][6])

My second talk was an [[Ignite_(event)|Ignite]] talk on the importance of beta testing plugins. Ignite talks are five minute lightning talks with 20 slides which auto-advance every 15 seconds. ([SlideShare][7], [SpeakerRate][8])



The videos for both talks will ultimately go up on [wordpress.tv][9].

The event was a huge success and I&#8217;m looking forward to help organize WordCamp Boston 2011 as well! <img src="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
