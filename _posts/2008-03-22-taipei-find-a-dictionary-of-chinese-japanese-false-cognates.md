The fact that Japanese and Chinese both share the use of Chinese characters. The connection goes beyond simply sharing characters, though: many two- and four-character expressions in Japanese come from older Chinese (these are known as Sino-Japanese items in the [[linguistics|biz]]). This is how I can often &#8220;cheat&#8221; and use my knowledge of Japanese to guess what some Chinese words are saying, even if I have no idea how to pronounce them.

There are, however, many Chinese-Japanese false cognates—words which look the same and often do indeed have a shared etymology, but have quite different contemporary meanings.[^1] As such, I&#8217;ve often lamented to friends, especially learners of Japanese or Chinese, the lack of a dictionary highlighting these false cognates and how their usage differs between the Japanese and Chinese. A couple weekends ago I was browsing dictionaries in the Page One bookstore in [[Taipei 101]] and I found exactly that: 誤用度100%日語漢子.

Each spread shows the three sets of cognates, with an explanation of the Japanese use, in Chinese, on the left, and vice versa on the right. It&#8217;s a godsend.

By the way, here&#8217;s my favorite Chinese-Japanese false cognate:

### 勉強 (べんきょう)

one&#8217;s study (N), to study (V) ~する

### 勉強 (miǎnqiǎng)

*   V 
    1.  force sb. to do sth. | ¹Bié ∼ tā. Don&#8217;t force him to do it.
    2.  do with difficulty
*   [[static verb|S.V.]] 
    1.  unconvincing; strained | Zhège jìhuà ¹hěn ∼. This plan may not work.
*   Adv 
    1.  reluctantly; grudgingly | Tā ∼ xiàole yīxià. He forced a smile.
    2.  barely enough | Tā ∼ néng shuō jǐ jù Fǎyǔ. She can speak only a little French.

    In French, they&#8217;re &#8220;faux amis,&#8221; but I think that sounds more like a spy.
