Happy May! May, as you surely know, is an important season of celebration for linguists. Some of my favorite items are below.

From [Dates in the Month of May that Are of Interest to Linguists][1] by the late [[James D. McCawley]]:

> May 6, 1939. The University of Chicago trades Leonard Bloomfield to Yale University for two janitors and an undisclosed number of concrete gargoyles.   
>   
> May 23, 38,471&#160;B.C. God creates language.   
>   
> May 29, 1962. Angular brackets are discovered. Classes at M.I.T. are dismissed and much Latvian plum brandy is consumed.   
>   
> May 31, 1951. Chomsky discovers Affix-hopping and is reprimanded by his father for discovering rules on shabas. 
Unfortunately May 31, 1951 was a Thursday&#8230;
