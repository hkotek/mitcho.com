Here&#8217;s a quick demonstration of Ubiquity Parser 2, aka &#8220;the new parser.&#8221; I&#8217;ll show you how you can use the parser yourself and point out some highlights of the new functionality.

  
[Ubiquity Parser 2: better noun-first suggestions and command localization][1] from [mitcho][2] on [Vimeo][3].

<!--more-->

Testing Parser 2 requires the latest Ubiquity source, as explained [here][4]. If you find any problems or suggestions, please add a ticket to [our trac][5] with the keyword `new-parser`.

Here are some resources for those of you who would like to read more about different features touched on in this video:

*   [The design document for the new parser][6]
*   [Writing commands with semantic roles][7] and [a proposed inventory of semantic roles][8]
*   [Some thoughts on noun-first suggestions and Ubiquity in Japanese][9]

In the near future we&#8217;ll also be writing up some documentation on how to take advantage of this new parser in your commands as well.
