I&#8217;m certainly not the first one who&#8217;s noticed that Japanese apartment buildings often have weird English names (I can think of [[Tony László]] in one of the [[Is He Turning Japanese%3F|ダーリンは外国人]] books.) In fact, I moved into my very own &#8220;Palace Mansion&#8221; myself a couple weeks ago. No, really. That&#8217;s the name of the place.

A mansion? By Japanese standards, yes.[^2] A palace? Um&#8230; not quite. Take a look—here are some pictures from my move-in.

The apartment has three bedrooms and shared small kitchen/dining room, bath, and toilet. I live here with two other Japanese salary-men who are older than I. We all live pretty busy lives and don&#8217;t run into each other much. And, believe it or not, I found it on [Tokyo Craigslist][1].

While it may not resemble a &#8220;palace mansion,&#8221; it definitely has its perks. For starters, it&#8217;s a fifteen-twenty minute walk from my work, which is a great plus in a land of long train commutes. It&#8217;s in a quiet, down-to-earth neighborhood—right next to the Children&#8217;s Center and a block or two from a old-style shopping district (商店街 *shōtengai*)—while also one train station away from [[Shinjuku station]], which is a major transit hub.[^3] There&#8217;s a fabulous (and apparently slightly famous) [[ramen]] a couple doors down. And finally, while small, it&#8217;s definitely one of the cheapest places I saw.

But let&#8217;s back up a moment and let you in on how I got here.

I moved from Taiwan to Japan at the end of June after the end of my Fulbright. [^1] While doing the regular job search[^4] I registered with a search firm with a focus on bilinguals, [Robert Walters][2]. I had a great experience with them and ultimately accepted a position introduced to me by them. I started on August first as Online Game Programmer at [[Gameloft]].[^5]

I was weary of blogging about my job search at all during it, but I hope to break the radio silence and start blogging again about my new life here in Tokyo. ^^

    マンション (&#8220;mansion&#8221;) in Japanese actually refers to an apartment complex of at least a certain size. It&#8217;s an instance of [[wasei-eigo|和製英語]]—English-sounding words in the Japanese lexicon which, for some reason or another, do not actually exist or mean the same thing in English.

    Um, by which I mean, [[Shinjuku station|the biggest train station in the world by passenger volume]].

    If you&#8217;d been [following me on Twitter][3], however, you would have been at least slightly more in touch with my life. :p

    Some of my best resources included [ecentral][4] (where I almost took a job, actually), [daijob][5], and [enjapan][6]. I also went to a job fair focusing on bilingual (or semi-bilingual) job-seekers: [Career Forum (CFN)][7]. I should also express my disgust toward [recruit][8], the big household name among job sites, now operated by Yahoo, just as I found it very difficult to use/navigate and seemingly ill-planned-out. [[YMMV]].

    Speaking of, &#8220;the views expressed on these pages are mine alone and not those of my employer.&#8221; I should probably add that somewhere&#8230; I&#8217;ll get on it.
