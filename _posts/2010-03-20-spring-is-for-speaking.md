I recently confirmed three different very exciting speaking gigs which I&#8217;ll be doing this spring:

<!--more-->

**JSConf.us**:

I&#8217;ll be putting my Mozilla Jetpack Ambassador hat on to represent Mozilla Labs&#8217; [Jetpack project][1] at the premier Javascript conference in North America, [JSConf.us][2], which this year will be April 17-18 in Washington D.C. and has a pirate theme.[^2] I&#8217;ll be giving a short talk in the main session and will also lead a hands-on Jetpack workshop in the hacker lounge. I&#8217;ve heard that JSConf is a lot of fun and I&#8217;m really looking forward to it! <img src="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

**WordCamp San Francisco**:

I&#8217;m honored to have been invited to give a talk at [WordCamp San Francisco 2010][3]. WordCamps are community-organized events for the [WordPress][4] community, and the San Francisco WordCamp is the original and biggest. WordCamp SF will be at the Mission Bay Conference Center on May 1st. [Tickets available][5].

My talk is tentatively titled &#8220;Abstract Your Code.&#8221;[^1] WordPress is a great platform to build amazing content-rich applications on, and many of us have written new functionality in the form of plugins. I hope to encourage developers to make their code more portable and reusable after the project is done—or, ideally, to even start with abstraction in mind—to add to the &#8220;life&#8221; of the code and to consider then open-sourcing that functionality.

Hope to see you there!

**International Association of Chinese Linguistics (IACL) 18**:

Finally, I&#8217;m thrilled to say that I got a paper accepted to the [annual meeting of the International Association of Chinese Linguistics][6] which this year is at Harvard on May 20-22. IACL is *the* big conference for Chinese linguistics, with about [180 papers presenting][7]. I&#8217;ll be presenting *Two* Only*s in Mandarin Chinese*, my recent work on the formal syntax/semantics of two *only* words in Chinese: *zhǐ* (只) and *éryǐ* (而已). I&#8217;ve put up [a handout][8] of some of this material in work-in-progress form which I recently presented at [SNEWS][9].

    I&#8217;ll [fit right in][10].
