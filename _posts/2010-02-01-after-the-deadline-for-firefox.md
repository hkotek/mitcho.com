[After the Deadline][1] is a powerful and intelligent proofreading tool which checks for spelling errors, misused words, some grammatical gaffes, and even some stylistic issues. For the past month, I&#8217;ve been working for [Automattic][2], the company behind AtD and the makers of [WordPress.com][3], to create a Firefox add-on which enables this superior technology everywhere on the web. Words can&#8217;t do justice to the magic that is AtD, so here&#8217;s a video we put together:

I invite you all to give it a spin:

Working on After the Deadline for Firefox gave me my first experience creating an add-on from the ground up and I&#8217;ve learned a lot. After working on Ubiquity and dabbling with Jetpack, it&#8217;s given me another perspective on extensibility on the web and I look forward to thinking and writing more about these experiences in the near future.

In the mean time, happy proofreading! <img src="http://mitcho.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />
