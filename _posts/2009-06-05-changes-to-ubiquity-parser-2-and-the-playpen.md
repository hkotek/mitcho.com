Here&#8217;s a quick screencast highlighting some of the changes to Parser 2 and the updated [Parser 2 Playpen][1]. This video should be particularly useful to people hoping to [add their language to Parser 2][2]. It&#8217;s also a good reference for Ubiquity core developers.

  
[Changes to Ubiquity Parser 2 + Playpen][3] from [mitcho][4] on [Vimeo][5].

All the features covered, as with all Parser 2 features, require that you [get the latest Ubiquity code][6] from our Mercurial repository.
