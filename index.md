## Hello!

I am an Assistant Professor in **Linguistics** at the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg) ([Department of English Language & Literature](http://fas.nus.edu.sg/ell/)). I study the structure of sentences (**syntax**) and how these structures map to meaning (**semantics**). Much of my work is based on fieldwork on understudied and endangered languages. I received my Ph.D. from [MIT Linguistics](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/) in 2014. In a previous life, I was active in the [Mozilla (Firefox)](http://mozilla.org) and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) open-source communities.

## Areas of interest

*   syntax and semantics of focus and movement
*   the syntax of case, agreement, and movement
*   internet corpora and experiments

In previous work I have worked on: Mandarin Chinese, English, Japanese, Kaqchikel (Mayan; Guatemala), Squliq Atayal (Austronesian; Taiwan), Tibetan.

See the new [Projects](/projects) page for descriptions of projects and downloadable papers.
