## Hello!

I am a linguist broadly interested in the structure of sentences (syntax) and how these structures map to meaning (semantics). I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/department-linguistics) at [McGill University](http://mcgill.ca). In a previous life, I was an active coder in the [Mozilla (Firefox)](http://mozilla.org) and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) open-source communities.

## Areas of interest

*   syntax and semantics of focus and movement
*   the syntax of case, agreement, and movement
*   internet corpora and experiments

In previous work I have worked on: Mandarin Chinese, English, Japanese, Kaqchikel (Mayan; Guatemala), Squliq Atayal (Austronesian; Taiwan).

See the new [Projects](/projects) page for descriptions of projects and downloadable papers.

## Teaching

*   Fall 2014: Research seminar [&#8220;Questions, focus, and friends&#8221;](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~michael.erlewine/focus-wh/) with [Hadas Kotek](http://hkotek.com)

## Recent

*   [&#8220;Anti-locality and optimality in Kaqchikel Agent Focus&#8221;](/research/af.html) has been accepted for publication (pending minor revisions) in [*Natural Language & Linguistic Theory*](https://www.springer.com/education+%26+language/linguistics/journal/11049)!
