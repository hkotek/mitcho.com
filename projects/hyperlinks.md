A unique property of the hypertext medium is that authors naturally identify certain stretches of text as units, in the form of <span style='text-decoration: underline'>inline hyperlinks</span>. **What kind of linguistic objects are inline hyperlinks?** I have investigated this question through a 5.7M word corpus of English hypertext, which includes 375k links. Manual annotation of a sample of 5,000 links in the corpus found that 94% of inline links are constituents in their host sentences, with the exceptions largely clustering into other kinds of linguistic objects, e.g. constituents modulo a large adjunct not included at the right edge. I am pursuing the hypothesis that **hyperlinking is a process constrained by the author's knowledge of the text's underlying linguistic structure**, and therefore could ultimately be used as **a test for syntactic constituency**, once we better understand the possible range of exceptions.
