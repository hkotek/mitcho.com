The interpretation of focus-sensitive operators such as 'only' and 'even' depends on the presence of a focused constituent in their scope. I document the complex conditions under which **focus-sensitive operators are able to associate with a focused constituent which has moved out of their scope**. In particular, I concentrate on the ability of English 'even' but not 'only' to associate "backwards" in this configuration. I propose **a theory based on the Copy Theory of movement** which predicts the attested patterns of backwards association. When an operator gives the appearance of associating backwards, it is in fact associating with focus in the lower copy of the movement chain, within its scope. Differences in the availability of backwards association between 'only,' 'even,' and 'also' are shown to follow from independent semantic differences. The proposal explains a range of constraints on patterns of focus association, and more generally contributes to our understanding of the interaction of the syntactic operation of movement with the semantic and information-structural notion of focus.
