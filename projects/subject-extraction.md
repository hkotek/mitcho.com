A'-extraction of subjects is cross-linguistically marked, requiring a difference in complementizer or verbal morphology. I put forward the hypothesis that many such quirks of subject extraction result from an **anti-locality constraint on A'-movement** which blocks movement which is *too short*; specifically, subject movement from Spec,TP to Spec,CP is blocked, necessitating the use of an additional strategy for subject extraction.

This view is motivated by my work on **Agent Focus in Kaqchikel** (Mayan; Guatemala). Kaqchikel is a morphologically ergative Mayan language where the A'-extraction of subjects of transitives (ergative arguments) requires special verbal morphology, known as *Agent Focus* (AF). Through my fieldwork on Kaqchikel, I discovered cases where the extraction of an ergative subject does *not* require AF. In particular, when additional clausal material is projected between the base position of the ergative subject and its landing site, AF becomes unnecessary and in fact impossible. I propose an anti-locality-based solution in my *Natural Language & Linguistic Theory* paper, which also accounts for the distribution of AF in certain person agreement combinations.

I have also applied this anti-locality approach to **the English *that*-trace effect** and am currently exploring further applications of this approach to so-called \"anti-agreement\" and highest subject restriction phenomena.
