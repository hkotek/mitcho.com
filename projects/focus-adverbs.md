title: The position of focus adverbs

I am currently studying the structural placement of adverbial focus operators, for example **adverbial 'only' words in Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese.** I observe that in languages that allow adverbial focus operators at different attachment heights on the clausal spine, there is a generalization that, within each clausal domain, **a focus operator must be *as low as possible* while c-commanding its associate**. Jacobs (1983) and BÃ¼ring & Hartmann (2001) describe the distribution of German focus adverbs in similar terms, but its cross-linguistic generality has not been explored and the nature of this "as low as possible" description has not been adequately studied.
