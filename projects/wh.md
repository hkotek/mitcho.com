Aside from their canonical interrogative use, *wh*-words are used in many languages to build a range of quantificational expressions. What syntactic and semantic strategies are employed to quantify over the alternatives introduced by *wh*-words? To answer this question, [**Hadas Kotek**](http://hkotek.com) and I have recently looked at a number of non-interrogative *wh*-constructions, in Chuj (Mayan), Dharamsala Tibetan, and English.

We have investigated **bare *wh*-indefinites and free relatives in Chuj**, an understudied Mayan language of Guatemala. We show that **indefinite free relatives in Chuj are equivalent in size to definite free relatives**, as proposed by Caponigro (2003), contrary to a conjecture by Šimík (2011) that indefinite free relatives are always reduced clauses.

We also investigate ***wh*-even NPIs in Dharamsala Tibetan.** We present a new compositional syntax/semantics for *wh*-even NPIs, improving upon previous analyses such as Ramchand (1996), with implications for the analysis of 'even.' Our analysis uses **both the scalar and additive meanings** introduced by 'even,' and crucially computes these two meanings with different scopes. I am exploring an extention of this account to the behavior of *wh*-even NPIs in Japanese and other languages.

In other work, we have investigated the syntax and semantics of ***wh*-words used as relative pronouns**. Using [the intervention effect diagnostics which we pioneered](/projects/piedpiping), we show that relative pronouns in English non-restrictive relatives are interpreted in-situ within their pied-piping constituents via focus alternative computation. We show that this supports the view that **non-restrictive relatives are proposition-denoting**, rather than property-denoting.
