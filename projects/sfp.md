title: Sentence-final particles in Mandarin Chinese

Most of the clausal spine in Mandarin Chinese is rigidly head-initial, with the apparent exception of the set of sentence-final particles (SFPs). Previous work has analyzed SFPs as being head-final heads in the CP domain above a head-initial TP---an important apparent counterexample to Biberauer, Holmberg, and Roberts' \"Final Over Final Constraint.\" I contribute new data on the semantic scope of SFPs, leading to the conclusion that **some SFPs must be lower in the clause**, in a position that I identify with the lower phase edge, traditionally identified with *v*P. This work is important not only for our understanding of Chinese clause structure, but also for our understanding of **the Final Over Final Constraint** and its apparent exceptions.
