title: Clefts, cleft questions, and QUD congruence

I am interested in the cross-linguistic syntax and semantics of *clefts* and, more generally, grammatical markers which make reference to the Question Under Discussion (QUD). This interest stems from my investigation of **the Mandarin Chinese focus marker *shì* 是**, which I argue expresses **cleft semantics without a \"cleaving\" syntax** which separates the focused pivot from its background, as an English *it*-cleft does. I show that *shì* requires the material in its scope to be congruent to an accepted QUD, supporting the view that **cleft semantics is QUD-dependent** (Velleman et al 2012), unlike other exclusives such as *only*. I also investigate the syntax and semantics of **\"cleft questions,\"** such as the English *Who is it that came last night?*, which seem to be an instance of backwards focus association as investigated in [my dissertation](/research/dissertation.html).
