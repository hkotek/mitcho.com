In 2009, I worked as a researcher at Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser. I contributed to the development of [Ubiquity](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquity_%28Firefox%29), **an open-source, text-based natural language interface** for the browser. I led the design and development of a lightweight parser which could then be easily localized by the community.
