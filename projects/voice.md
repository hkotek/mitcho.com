I am currently working with [**Theodore Levin**](https://sites.google.com/site/tfranklevin/) and [**Coppe van Urk**](http://web.mit.edu/cvanurk/www/) on developing a new approach to Austronesian voice systems. Austronesian "voice" systems commonly exhibit a one-to-one correspondence between "voice" morphology on the verb, morphological case on nominals, and the availability of A'-movement. Based on cases where this correspondance breaks down, as well as on variation across Austronesian in the realization of this voice system, we argue that **voice morphology is extraction marking**, reflecting the choice of argument moved to a particular position. We explain **the effects of voice on case marking** by proposing that the relevant position is a mixed A/A'-position, where the external argument can receive Case. Voices where the external argument does not move to this position, then, require a separate mechanism to license the external argument.

This current work builds on my previous investigation of **voice and subjecthood in Atayal**, an endangered Atayalic language of Taiwan. I studied Squliq Atayal while on a Fulbright fellowship in Taiwan in 2007â€“2008 and also during summer 2012 funded by an [NSF East Asian/Pacific Institute award](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1209550). The sentence-final "subject" position in Atayal can be optionally marked by *qu*, which has traditionally been described as a nominative/absolutive case marker. However, I show that when the subject of the clause (as determined by Voice morphology on the verb) is displaced, another specific, non-subject argument can be marked by *qu*. I argue that the *qu* marker on sentence-final arguments is an information-structual marker of topic, rather than a case marker.

I have also recently begun work on **Toba Batak**, an understudied Austronesian language of northern Sumatra, Indonesia, with a focus on its voice system and patterns of extraction.
