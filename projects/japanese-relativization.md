[**Isaac Gould**](//linguistics.ku.edu/isaac-gould) and I have investigated the structure and interpretation of **head-internal relative clauses in Japanese** and their lesser-studied doubly-headed variants. We present new evidence that these relatives are best analyzed as definite descriptions, rather than through E-type anaphora, and present an analysis that accounts for their readings in different contexts. In our most recent work, we propose a novel **DP head-raising derivation** for relative clauses that takes advantage of the Copy Theory of movement and the late-merger of relative clauses. This allows for the unification of head-internal and doubly-headed relativization strategies with the familiar head-external form, which would otherwise not be possible.
